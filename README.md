# simple_todo_manager

A super simple todo manager

## Getting Started

This project is my starting point to learn about various concepts in Flutter
- state management
- widget testing
- best practices (prefer stateless widgets over stateful, do not cram everything into one build context, etc.)
- designing clean UI elements
- animations
- etc...

A few resources for specific topics:

- [Flutter app testing codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-app-testing)
- [Flutter testing cookbook](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing)
- [Provider for state management](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple)

Credits:
- The app uses an icon downloaded from Icons8
  - Illustration by Icons 8 from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
